        <h1>Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game</h1>
        <hr />
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          A massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) is a video
          game that combines aspects of a role-playing video game and a
          massively multiplayer online game.
        </p>
        <p>
          As in role-playing games (RPGs), the player assumes the role of a
          character (often in a fantasy world or science-fiction world) and
          takes control over many of that character's actions. MMORPGs are
          distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by
          the number of players able to interact together, and by the game's
          persistent world (usually hosted by the game's publisher), which
          continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away
          from the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          MMORPGs are played throughout the world. Global revenues for MMORPGs
          exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005,[1] and the western world's
          revenues exceeded a billion dollars in 2006.[2] In 2008, the spending
          on subscription MMORPGs by consumers in North America and Europe grew
          to $1.4 billion.[3] World of Warcraft, a popular MMORPG, had over 10
          million subscribers as of November 2014.[4] World of Warcraft's total
          revenue was $1.04 billion US dollars in 2014.[5] Star Wars: The Old
          Republic, released in 2011, became the world's "fastest-growing
          subscription MMO in history" after gaining more than 1 million players
          within the first three days of its launch.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2 id="common-features">Common Features</h2>
        <p>
          Although modern MMORPGs sometimes differ dramatically from their
          predecessors, many of them share the same basic characteristics. These
          include several common features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Persistent game environment</li>
          <li>Some form of level progression</li>
          <li>Social interaction within the game</li>
          <li>In-game culture</li>
          <li>Membership in a group</li>
          <li>Character customization</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="#theme">Theme</h4>
        <p>
          The majority of popular MMORPGs are based on traditional fantasy
          themes, often occurring in an in-game universe comparable to that of
          Dungeons & Dragons. Some employ hybrid themes that either merge or
          replace fantasy elements with those of science fiction, sword and
          sorcery, or crime fiction. Others draw thematic material from American
          comic books, the occult, and other genres. These elements are often
          developed using similar tasks and scenarios involving quests,
          monsters, and loot.
        </p>
        <h4>Progression</h4>
        <p>
          In nearly all MMORPGs, the development of the player's character is
          the primary goal. Nearly all MMORPGs feature a character progression
          system, in which players earn experience points for their actions and
          use those points to reach character "levels", which makes them better
          at whatever they do.[8] Traditionally, combat with monsters and
          completing quests for non-player characters, either alone or in
          groups, are the primary ways to earn experience points. The
          accumulation of wealth (including combat-useful items) is also a way
          to progress in many MMORPGs. This is traditionally best accomplished
          via combat. The cycle produced by these conditions, combat leading to
          new items allowing for more combat with no change in gameplay, is
          sometimes pejoratively referred to as the level treadmill, or
          "grinding". The role-playing game Progress Quest was created as a
          parody of this trend. Eve Online, a space-based MMORPG, uses an
          alternative method of progression where users train skills in
          real-time rather than using experience points as a measure of
          progression.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some MMORPGs, there is no limit to a player's level, allowing the
          grinding experience to continue indefinitely. MMORPGs that use this
          model often glorify top ranked players by displaying their avatars on
          the game's website or posting their stats on a high score screen.
          Another common practice is to enforce a maximum reachable level for
          all players, often referred to as a level cap. Once reached, the
          definition of a player's progression changes. Instead of being awarded
          primarily with experience for completing quests and dungeons, the
          player's motivation to continue playing will be replaced with
          collecting money and equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often, the widened range of equipment available at the maximum level
          will have increased aesthetic value to distinguish high ranking
          players in game between lower ranked players. Colloquially known as
          endgame gear, this set of empowered weapons and armor adds a
          competitive edge to both scripted boss encounters as well as player vs
          player combat. Player motivation to outperform others is fueled by
          acquiring such items and is a significant determining factor in their
          success or failure in combat-related situations.
        </p>
        <h4>Social Interation</h4>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_interaction_in_MMORPGs"
          >Main article: Social interaction via MMORPGs</a
        >
        <p>
          MMORPGs almost always have tools to facilitate communication between
          players. Many MMORPGs offer support for in-game guilds or clans,
          though these will usually form whether the game supports them or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, most MMOGs require some degree of teamwork in parts of
          the game. These tasks usually require players to take on roles in the
          group, such as protecting other players from damage (called tanking),
          "healing" damage done to other players or damaging enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          MMORPGs generally have Game Moderators or Game Masters (frequently
          referred to as GMs or "mods"), who may be paid employees or unpaid
          volunteers who attempt to supervise the world. Some GMs may have
          additional access to features and information related to the game that
          are not available to other players and roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Relationships formed in MMORPGs can often be just as intense as
          relationships formed between friends or partners met outside the game,
          and often involve elements of collaboration and trust between players.
        </p>
        <h4>Roleplaying</h4>
        <p>
          Most MMORPGs provide different types of classes that players can
          choose. Among those classes, a small portion of players choose to
          roleplay their characters, and there are rules that provide
          functionality and content to those who do. Community resources such as
          forums and guides exist in support of this play style.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a player wants to play a priest role in his MMORPG
          world, that player might buy a cope from a shop and learn priestly
          skills, proceeding to speak, act, and interact with others as their
          character would. This may or may not include pursuing other goals such
          as wealth or experience. Guilds or similar groups with a focus on
          roleplaying may develop extended in-depth narratives using the setting
          and resources similar to those in the game world
        </p>
        <h4>Culture</h4>
        <p>
          Over time, the MMORPG community has developed a sub-culture with its
          own slang and metaphors, as well as an unwritten list of social rules
          and taboos. Players will often complain about 'grind' (a slang term
          for any repetitive, time-consuming activity in an MMORPG), or talk
          about 'buffs' and 'nerfs' (respectively an upgrade or downgrade of a
          particular game mechanic).
        </p>
        <p>
          As with all such cultures, social rules exist for such things as
          invitations to join an adventuring party, the proper division of
          treasure, and how a player is expected to behave while grouped with
          other players.
        </p>
        <h4>System architecture</h4>
        <p>
          Most MMORPGs are deployed using a client–server system architecture.
          The server software generates a persistent instance of the virtual
          world that runs continuously, and players connect to it via a client
          software. The client software may provide access to the entire playing
          world, or further 'expansions' may be required to be purchased to
          allow access to certain areas of the game. EverQuest and Guild Wars
          are two examples of games that use such a format. Players generally
          must purchase the client software for a one-time fee, although an
          increasing trend is for MMORPGs to work using pre-existing "thin"
          clients, such as a web browser
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the number of players and the system architecture, an
          MMORPG might be run on multiple separate servers, each representing an
          independent world, where players from one server cannot interact with
          those from another; World of Warcraft is a prominent example, with
          each separate server housing several thousand players. In many MMORPGs
          the number of players in one world is often limited to around a few
          thousand, but a notable example of the opposite is EVE Online, which
          accommodates several hundred thousand players on the same server, with
          over 60,000 playing simultaneously (June 2010[12]) at certain times.
          Some games allow characters to appear on any world, but not
          simultaneously (such as Seal Online: Evolution or Kolossium
          competition in Dofus); others limit each character to the world in
          which it was created. World of Warcraft has experimented with
          "cross-realm" (i.e. cross-server) interaction in player vs player
          "battlegrounds", using server clusters or "battlegroups" to
          co-ordinate players looking to participate in structured player vs
          player content such as the Warsong Gulch or Alterac Valley
          battlegrounds.[13] Additionally, patch 3.3, released on December 8,
          2009, introduced a cross-realm "looking for group" system to help
          players form groups for instanced content (though not for open-world
          questing) from a larger pool of characters than their home server can
          necessarily provide.
        </p>
        <h4>Business Models</h4>
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_games"
          >See also: List of massively multiplayer online role-playing games</a
        >
        <p>
          MMORPGs today use a wide range of business models, from free of
          charge, free with microtransactions, advertise funded, to various
          kinds of payment plans. Some MMORPGs require payment or a monthly
          subscription to play. By definition, "massively multiplayer" games are
          always online, and most require some sort of continuous revenue (such
          as monthly subscriptions and advertisements) for maintenance and
          development purposes. Some games, such as Guild Wars, have disposed of
          the 'monthly fee' model entirely, and recover costs directly through
          sales of the software and associated expansion packs. Still others
          adopt a micropayment model where the core content is free, but players
          are given the option to purchase additional content, such as
          equipment, aesthetic items, or pets. Games that make use of this model
          often have originated in Korea, such as Flyff and MapleStory. This
          business model is alternately called "pay for perks" or "freemium",
          and games using it often describe themselves with the term
          "free-to-play".
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Free-to-play (F2P) means that there is no cost to purchase the
            software and there is no subscription charge. Variably applies to
            traditionally bought and forever available games (see Buy-to-play
            below). Most newer MMOs that fall under this category now includes
            microtransactions however, which causes them to overlap with the
            Freemium model.
          </li>
          <li>
            Freemium (a portmanteau of free-to-play and premium) means that the
            majority or all of the game's content is available for free but
            players can pay for extra content, character customization, added
            perks or faster advancement into the game via microtransactions.
            Freemium thus overlaps with both the free-to-play and pay-to-play
            models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Buy-to-play (B2P) means that the MMO can only be played by
            purchasing the game, but there is no subsequent subscription fee for
            playing the game. These games may or may not include additional
            microtransactions, or may sell additional content in the form of
            expansions instead of asking for an ongoing subscription fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pay-to-play (P2P) means that the MMO requires a monthly subscription
            fee or other ongoing fee in order to continue playing the game. It
            may also require an up-front purchase of the game in addition to the
            monthly subscription fee, though many of these up-front purchases
            include a month of game time. This was once the most common way for
            MMOs to finance themselves, but has fallen out of favor in recent
            years as an increasing number of games have switched to other
            business models due to difficulty in retaining a stable playerbase.
          </li>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_massively_multiplayer_online_games"
          >Main article: History of massively multiplayer online games</a
        >
        <p>
          MMORPG is a term coined by Richard Garriott to refer to massive
          multiplayer online role-playing games and their social
          communities.[11][15] Previous to this and related coinages, these
          games were generally called graphical MUDs; the history of MMORPGs
          traces back directly through the MUD genre.[16][17] Through this
          connection, MMORPGs can be seen to have roots in the earliest
          multi-user games such as Mazewar (1974) and MUD1 (1978). 1985 saw the
          release of a roguelike (pseudo-graphical) MUD called Island of Kesmai
          on CompuServe[18] and Lucasfilm's graphical MUD Habitat.[19] The first
          fully graphical multi-user RPG was Neverwinter Nights, which was
          delivered through America Online in 1991 and was personally championed
          by AOL President Steve Case.[20] Other early proprietary graphical
          online RPGs include three on The Sierra Network: The Shadow of
          Yserbius in 1992, The Fates of Twinion in 1993, and The Ruins of
          Cawdor in 1995. Another milestone came in 1995 as NSFNET restrictions
          were lifted, opening the Internet up for game developers, which
          allowed for the first truly "massively"-scoped titles. Finally,
          MMORPGs as defined today began with Meridian 59 in 1996, innovative
          both in its scope and in offering first-person 3D graphics, with The
          Realm Online appearing nearly simultaneously.[20] Ultima Online,
          released in 1997, is often credited with first popularizing the
          genre,[20] though more mainstream attention was garnered by 1999's
          EverQuest and Asheron's Call in the West[20] and 1996's Nexus: The
          Kingdom of the Winds in South Korea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The financial success of these early titles has ensured competition in
          the genre since that time. MMORPG titles now exist on consoles and in
          new settings. In 2008, the market for MMORPGs had Blizzard
          Entertainment's World of Warcraft dominating as the largest
          MMORPG,[21] alongside other titles such as Final Fantasy XIV and Guild
          Wars 2, though an additional market exists for free-to-play MMORPGs,
          which are supported by advertising and purchases of in-game items.
          This free-to-play model is particularly common in South Korea such as
          MapleStory, Rohan: Blood Feud, Atlantica Online and Lost Ark. Also,
          there are some free-to-play games, such as RuneScape and Tibia, where
          the game is free, but one would have to pay monthly to play the game
          with more features. Guild Wars and its sequel avoid some degree of
          competition with other MMORPGs by only requiring the initial purchase
          of the game to play.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          The cost of developing a competitive commercial MMORPG title often
          exceeded $10 million in 2003.[22] These projects require multiple
          disciplines within game design and development such as 3D modeling, 2D
          art, animation, user interfaces, client/server engineering, database
          architecture, and network infrastructure.[23]
        </p>
        <p>
          The front-end (or client) component of a commercial, modern MMORPG
          features 3D graphics. As with other modern 3D games, the front-end
          requires expertise with implementing 3D engines, real-time shader
          techniques and physics simulation. The actual visual content (areas,
          creatures, characters, weapons, spaceships and so forth) is developed
          by artists who typically begin with two-dimensional concept art, and
          later convert these concepts into animated 3D scenes, models and
          texture maps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developing an MMOG server requires expertise with client/server
          architecture, network protocols, security, and database design.
          MMORPGs include reliable systems for a number of vital tasks. The
          server must be able to handle and verify a large number of
          connections, prevent cheating, and apply changes (bug fixes or added
          content) to the game. A system for recording the games data at regular
          intervals, without stopping the game, is also important
        </p>
        <p>
          Maintenance requires sufficient servers and bandwidth, and a dedicated
          support staff. Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to lag and
          frustration for the players, and can severely damage the reputation of
          a game, especially at launch. Care must also be taken to ensure that
          player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing
          servers. Peer-to-peer MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and
          efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as
          asymmetrical network bandwidth, CPU-hungry rendering engines,
          unreliability of individual nodes, and inherent lack of security
          (opening fertile new grounds for cheating) can make them a difficult
          proposition. The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG
          requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers.
          Developing an affordable infrastructure for an online game requires
          developers to scale large numbers of players with less hardware and
          network investment
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the development team will need to have expertise with the
          fundamentals of game design: world-building, lore and game
          mechanics,[27] as well as what makes games fun.
        </p>
        <h4>Non Corporate Development</h4>
        <p>
          Though the vast majority of MMORPGs are produced by companies, many
          small teams of programmers and artists have contributed to the genre.
          As shown above, the average MMORPG development project requires
          enormous investments of time and money, and running the game can be a
          long-term commitment. As a result, non-corporate (or independent, or
          "indie") development of MMORPGs is less common compared to other
          genres. Still, many independent MMORPGs do exist, representing a wide
          spectrum of genres, gameplay types, and revenue systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some independent MMORPG projects are completely open source, while
          others feature proprietary content made with an open-source game
          engine. The WorldForge project has been active since 1998 and formed a
          community of independent developers who are working on creating
          framework for a number of open-source MMORPGs. The Multiverse
          Foundation has also created a platform specifically for independent
          MMOG developers.

        <h2>Trends</h2>
        <p>
          As there are a number of wildly different titles within the genre, and
          since the genre develops so rapidly, it is difficult to definitively
          state that the genre is heading in one direction or another. Still,
          there are a few obvious developments. One of these developments is the
          raid group quest, or "raid",[32] which is an adventure designed for
          large groups of players (often twenty or more).
        </p>
        <h4>Instance Dungeons</h4>
        <p>
          Instance dungeons, sometimes shortened to "instances", are game areas
          that are "copied" for individual players or groups, which keeps those
          in the instance separated from the rest of the game world. This
          reduces competition, and also reducing the amount of data that needs
          to be sent to and from the server, reducing lag. The Realm Online was
          the first MMORPG to begin to use a rudimentary form of this technique
          and Anarchy Online would develop it further, using instances as a key
          element of gameplay. Since then, instancing has become increasingly
          common. The "raids", as mentioned above, often involve instance
          dungeons. Examples of games which feature instances are World of
          Warcraft, The Lord of the Rings Online, EverQuest, EverQuest II, Aion,
          Final Fantasy XIV, Guild Wars, Rift, RuneScape, Star Trek Online, Star
          Wars: The Old Republic, and DC Universe Online.
        </p>
        <h4>Player Created Content</h4>
        <p>Increased amounts of "player-created content" is another trend</p>
        <h4>Use of Licenses</h4>
        <p>
          The use of intellectual property licensing common in other video game
          genres has also appeared in MMORPGs. 2007 saw the release of The Lord
          of the Rings Online, based on J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. Other
          licensed MMORPGs include The Matrix Online, based on the Matrix
          trilogy of films, Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning, based on Games
          Workshop's table top game, Star Wars Galaxies, Star Wars The Old
          Republic, Champions Online and Age of Conan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, several licenses from television have been optioned for
          MMORPGs, for example Star Trek Online and Stargate Worlds (which was
          later canceled).
        </p>
        <h4>Console Based MMORPGs</h4>
        <p>
          The first console-based MMORPG was Phantasy Star Online for the
          Dreamcast.[34] The first console-based open-world MMORPG was Final
          Fantasy XI for the PlayStation 2. EverQuest Online Adventures, also on
          the PlayStation 2, was the first console MMORPG in North America.
          Although console-based MMORPGs are considered more difficult to
          produce,[35] the platform is gaining more attention.
        </p>
        <h4>Browser Based MMORPGs</h4>
        <p>
          With the popularization of Facebook and microtransactions came a wave
          of Flash and HTML5 based MMORPGs that use the free to play model. They
          require no download outside of a browser and usually have heavily
          integrated social media sharing features.
        </p>
        <h4>Smartphone Based MMORPGs</h4>
        <p>
          Smartphones with their GPS capabilities (amongst others) enable
          augmented reality in games such as Ingress and Pokémon Go. The games
          are enhanced by location and distance based tracking, bench marking
          goals or facilitating trade between players.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>In society and culture</h2>
        <h4>Psychological Effects</h4>
        <p>
          Since the interactions between MMORPG players are real, even if the
          environments are virtual, psychologists and sociologists are able to
          use MMORPGs as tools for academic research. Sherry Turkle has found
          that many people have expanded their emotional range by exploring the
          many different roles (including gender identities) that MMORPGs allow
          a person to explore
        </p>
        <p>
          Nick Yee has surveyed more than 35,000 MMORPG players over the past
          several years, focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of
          these games. Recent findings included that 15% of players become a
          guild-leader at one time or another, but most generally find the job
          tough and thankless;[37] and that players spend a considerable amount
          of time (often a third of their total time investment) doing things
          that are external to gameplay but part of the metagame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many players report that the emotions they feel while playing an
          MMORPG are very strong, to the extent that 8.7% of male and 23.2% of
          female players in a statistical study have had an online wedding.[39]
          Other researchers have found that the enjoyment of a game is directly
          related to the social organization of a game, ranging from brief
          encounters between players to highly organized play in structured
          groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a study by Zaheer Hussain and Mark D. Griffiths, it was found that
          just over one in five gamers (21%) said they preferred socializing
          online to offline. Significantly more male gamers than female gamers
          said that they found it easier to converse online than offline. It was
          also found that 57% of gamers had created a character of the opposite
          gender, and it is suggested that the online female persona has a
          number of positive social attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A German fMRT-study conducted by researchers of the Central Institute
          of Mental Health points towards impairments in social, emotional and
          physical aspects of the self-concept and a higher degree in avatar
          identification in addicted MMORPG players, compared to non-addicted
          and naive (nonexperienced) people.[42] These findings generally
          support Davis' cognitive behavioral model of Internet addiction, which
          postulates that dysfunctional self-related cognitions represent
          central factors contributing towards the development and maintenance
          of MMORPG addiction.[43] The high degree of avatar identification
          found by Leménager et al. in the addicted group of this study
          indicates that MMORPG playing may represent an attempt to compensate
          for impairments in self-concept. Psychotherapeutic interventions
          should therefore focus on the development of coping strategies for
          real-life situations in which addicted players tend to experience
          themselves as incompetent and inferior.
        </p>

          Richard Bartle, author of Designing Virtual Worlds, classified
          multiplayer RPG-players into four primary psychological groups. His
          classifications were then expanded upon by Erwin Andreasen, who
          developed the concept into the thirty-question Bartle Test that helps
          players determine which category they are associated with. With over
          650,000 test responses as of 2011, this is perhaps the largest ongoing
          survey of multiplayer game players.[44] Based on Bartle and Yee's
          research, Jon Radoff has published an updated model of player
          motivation that focuses on immersion, competition, cooperation and
          achievement.[45][46] These elements may be found not only in MMORPGs,
          but many other types of games and within the emerging field of
          gamification.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been numerous discussions and evaluations by various
          scholarly institutions regarding the long-term effects of video game
          overuse. Many news agencies have criticized video games as promoting
          violent tendencies in its player base and encouraging anti-social
          behaviors. Ultimately this culminated in the World Health Organization
          classifying the overuse of video games as "Technological Addiction" in
          May 2019.

        <h4>Disease Research</h4>
        <p>
          In World of Warcraft, a temporary design glitch attracted the
          attention of psychologists and epidemiologists across North America,
          when the "Corrupted Blood" disease of a monster began to spread
          unintentionally—and uncontrollably—into the wider game world. The
          Centers for Disease Control intended to use the incident as a research
          model to chart both the progression of a disease, and the potential
          human response to large-scale epidemic infection. However, due to
          Blizzard Entertainment's failure to keep statistical records of the
          event, the 2005 Corrupted Blood Outbreak ultimately failed to produce
          any results. Nevertheless, the CDC has continued to express interest
          in the use of MMORPGs for disease research
        </p>
        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
          It has been suggested by Springer University in Germany that MMORPGs
          encourage and provide opportunities to study and improve in economic
          theory by providing a controlled environment for the natural
          development of economic practices between players of including
          professions, trade, and services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research has shown that for the positive learner, game-based
          interaction could reduce inhibition as well as enhance the enjoyment
          and motivation of second language learning, but appears to be more
          suitable for learners of intermediate and higher levels of proficiency
          than language beginners
        </p>
        <h4>Therapeutic Applications</h4>
        <p>
          The Division of Autism and developmental disabilities published a
          significant report detailing the value of MMORPGs for the treatment of
          individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The report suggests that
          individuals with autism spectrum disorder could benefit from MMORPGs
          by being provided a space to freely develop social skills and
          communication skills without the stress of face-to-face contact. This
          in turn opens new pathways for social therapy for individuals with
          developmental disabilities.
        </p>
        <h4>Economics</h4>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_economy"
          >See also: Virtual economy</a
        >
        <p>
          Many MMORPGs feature living economies. Virtual items and currency have
          to be gained through play and have definite value for players.[53]
          Such a virtual economy can be analyzed (using data logged by the
          game)[53] and has value in economic research. More significantly,
          these "virtual" economies can affect the economies of the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the early researchers of MMORPGs was Edward Castronova, who
          demonstrated that a supply-and-demand market exists for virtual items
          and that it crosses over with the real world.[54] This crossover has
          some requirements of the game:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The ability for players to sell an item to each other for in-game
            (virtual) currency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bartering for items between players for items of similar value.
          </li>
          <li>The purchase of in-game items for real-world currency.</li>
          <li>Exchanges of real-world currencies for virtual currencies.</li>
          <li>
            The invention of user-created meta-currencies such as Dragon kill
            points to distribute in-game rewards.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The idea of attaching real-world value to "virtual" items has had a
          profound effect on players and the game industry, and even the
          courts.[56] The virtual currency selling pioneer IGE received a
          lawsuit from a World of Warcraft player for interfering in the
          economics and intended use of the game by selling WoW gold.[57]
          Castronova's first study in 2002 found that a highly liquid (if
          illegal) currency market existed, with the value of Everquest's
          in-game currency exceeding that of the Japanese yen.[58] Some people
          even make a living by working these virtual economies; these people
          are often referred to as gold farmers, and may be employed in game
          sweatshops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Game publishers usually prohibit the exchange of real-world money for
          virtual goods, but others actively promote the idea of linking (and
          directly profiting from) an exchange. In Second Life and Entropia
          Universe, the virtual economy and the real-world economy are directly
          linked. This means that real money can be deposited for game money and
          vice versa. Real-world items have also been sold for game money in
          Entropia, and some players of Second Life have generated revenues in
          excess of $100,000.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the issues confronting online economies include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The use of "bots" or automated programs, that assist some players in
            accumulating in-game wealth to the disadvantage of other players.
          </li>
          <li>
            The use of unsanctioned auction sites, which has led publishers to
            seek legal remedies to prevent their use based on
            intellectual-property claims.
          </li>
          <li>
            The emergence of virtual crime, which can take the form of both
            fraud against the player or publisher of an online game, and even
            real-life acts of violence stemming from in-game transactions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Linking real-world and virtual economies was rare in MMORPGs as of
          2008, as it is generally believed to be detrimental to gameplay. If
          real-world wealth can be used to obtain greater, more immediate
          rewards than skillful gameplay, the incentive for strategic roleplay
          and real game involvement is diminished. It could also easily lead to
          a skewed hierarchy where richer players gain better items, allowing
          them to take on stronger opponents and level up more quickly than less
          wealthy but more committed players.
